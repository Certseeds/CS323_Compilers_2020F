/**
 * Exercise
 * â€¢ JSON object
 * Write a struct definition of a JSON object.
 * You may refer to project 2 doc, Listing 2.
**/
// because default use c so use a macro to set the maximum size of name.
// this can descripe the definition of a json object.
/** for a json object that only have STRING,NUMBER,TRUE,FALSE,VNULL
  THE struct is only a TYPE struct without any sub-sturct.
  which means in union it set to primitive.
  in the first union, it can set the primitive's values.
**/
/**
 * for a json object which is a Array,
 * outer is A type,which inside have a ARRAYLIST's pointer.
 * in ARRAYLIST's pointer, it just have a type and a next pointer.
